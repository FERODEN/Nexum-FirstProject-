				<h3>Lily Siri</h3>
				<p>I've been working in hotel buisness for 15 years, but I've never known my rooms need to be changed drastically. Now every second client leaves a review about, highlighting our comfortable rooms.</p>

				<h3>Sean Kendly</h3>
				<p>The design works like magic. It makes rooms of my hotel so cozy, but also elaborate. Henceforth, the number of our clients has become twice as high, and mostly they say they choose us after seeing our room photos.</p>

			<div class="QA">
					<details>
						<summary>How do you approach designing a hotel room?</summary>
                        <div class="answer"><p>We start with your brand, target guests, and budget. Then we balance aesthetics, functionality, and durability — because hotel rooms must look great and survive thousands of stays. Our process includes concept development, layout planning, materials selection, and final visualizations before anything is built.</p></div>
					</details>
                    <details>
						<summary>Can you design rooms for different hotel categories (boutique, luxury, business)?</summary>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Absolutely. We tailor each design to the hotel’s category and audience. A boutique hotel needs personality and storytelling, a business hotel prioritizes comfort and efficiency, while luxury spaces focus on premium materials and refined details. The goal is always the same: a memorable guest experience that matches your positioning.</p></div>
					</details>
					<details>
						<summary>Do you work with existing spaces or only new projects?</summary>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Both. We design rooms for new hotels as well as renovations of existing properties. When working with existing spaces, we optimize the layout, lighting, and furniture to modernize the room without unnecessary construction costs.</p></div>
